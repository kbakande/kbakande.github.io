FXBUD is a cloud‑based trading platform aimed at democratizing access to financial markets. As co‑founder, I designed and implemented the MLOps pipelines that power the platform’s recommendation systems and risk models.  The system leverages cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliable deployments and fast experimentation.
