## ðŸ“„ Resume Overview

I maintain multiple versions of my resume to suit different audiences and purposes:

- **One-Page Resume** â€“ A **summarised version of my career**, highlighting key roles and achievements for quick review in industry or fast-paced hiring processes.

- **Two-Page Resume** â€“ An **expanded version of my career**, offering deeper context on my technical contributions, leadership, and project outcomes â€” well-suited for more detailed industry or technical roles.

- **Extended Academic CV** â€“ A version **tailored towards the academic community**, designed to showcase my research background, publications, teaching, and scholarly contributions.

Feel free to explore and download the version most relevant to your interest.
