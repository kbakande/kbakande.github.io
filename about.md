  Hey there! Welcome to my page. Feel free to explore the site and dont forget to leave comments and likes!
</p>

My name is Kabeer, a machine learning engineer with years of industrial and academic experience. I have background in mathematical and statistical modelling as well as algorithm and software development. As a Data Science Fellow of the [S2DS programme](http://www.s2ds.org/), I have acquired commercial experiences that enable me add values to businesses by leveraging data and technologies. In my previous machine learning engineering role at the Big Data Enterprise and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory [Big-DEAL](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/bl/research/big-deal.aspx), I built a first-of-its-kind Alexa-type conversational bot for the construction industry. I also developed a recipe recommender system for [Mindful Chef](https://www.mindfulchef.com/) during my time there. In my current role as a senior data scientist at [OVO](https://www.ovoenergy.com/), I am developing customer clusters and propensity models for targeted marketing activities, debt recovery and product offerings. 

I am highly innovative in my approach and very effective in communicating my ideas as reflected with three granted [US patents](https://uspto.report/company/Akande-Kabiru) and over 50 peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PiWvuqYAAAAJ&hl=en).

 I am an ardent developer of technologies and well-known footballer (at least among my cohorts :)). Check out my various data science projects on my GitHub Page [@koakande.github](https://github.com/kbakande). You can shoot me an email at koakande@gmail.com, follow me on twitter [@koakande.twitter](https://twitter.com/koakande) and connect with me on Linkedln [@koakande.linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koakande/).
