  Hey there! Welcome to my page. Feel free to explore the site and dont forget to leave comments and likes!
</p>

My name is Kabeer, a machine learning engineer with years of industrial and academic experience. I have background in mathematical and statistical modelling as well as algorithm development. As a Data Science Fellow of the [S2DS programme](http://www.s2ds.org/), I have commercial experience in adding values to businesses using companies' data. I am currently working in conversational AI at the Big Data Enterprise and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory [Big-DEAL](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/bl/research/big-deal.aspx).

I am highly innovative in my approach and very effective in communicating my ideas, with a [US patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190081830A1/en) and over 40 peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PiWvuqYAAAAJ&hl=en).

 I am an ardent developer of technologies and well-known footballer (at least among my cohorts :)). Check out my various data science projects on my GitHub Page [@koakande.github](https://github.com/kbakande). You can shoot me an email at koakande@gmail.com, follow me on twitter [@koakande.twitter](https://twitter.com/koakande) and connect with me on Linkedln [@koakande.linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koakande/).
